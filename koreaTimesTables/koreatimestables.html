                            <p>The ASEAN-Korea Centre (AKC) hosted an event marking ASEAN Week 2021 at the COEX, Tuesday and Wednesday, to boost exchange and cooperation between ASEAN countries and Korea in a post-COVID-19 world. Launched in 2019, the flagship event of the AKC aims to raise awareness about ASEAN countries. This year's ASEAN Week was held in conjunction with the ASEAN-Korea & India Business Week 2021, hosted by the Presidential Committee on New Southern Policy, to supplement each other by offering programs in diverse fields from trade and investment to culture and young people. Due to the pandemic, this year's event was held in a hybrid format to reach a wider audience.</p>
